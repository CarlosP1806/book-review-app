# 📖 Book Review Application 

## 📃 Project Description
Best books is a book review web application that allows users to search books and read other users' reviews. It is powered by the Google Books API, so that millions of books are available for reviewing. In order to leave a review, users must create an account. The reviews database allows for basic CRUD operations: create a review, read a review, update and delete. Visit the live project hosted using Heroku at:
